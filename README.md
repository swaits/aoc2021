# Advent of Code 2021

This is my [AoC'21](https://adventofcode.com/2021) project.

I'm doing this with a few objectives in mind:

1. I'm not looking to impress anyone. I prefer to finish over being neat or clever. I didn't finish in 2019 and want to do better this year.
2. I'm using rust again. My rust skills were never great, but whatever was there at one point has faded away.
3. I plan to minimize dependencies. I only want to pull in crates when they'll make an objectively large difference. When I can write simple, small functions instead of pulling in a crate, I will.

If you happen to see this and have suggestions on how I can improve my rust, please send them my way!
